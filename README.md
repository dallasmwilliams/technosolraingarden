Project Title: Technosols offer a suitable replacement for sand-based filter media in rain garden design 

Project Description: Sand has traditionally been used to replace clay soil in rain garden (RG) design, however, the sustainability of sand is becoming uncertain due to high demand and finite supply. Technosol filter media was created by mixing technogenic materials (i.e. glass, shale, and shell) with clay soil and used as a replacement for sand in RGs. A column study was conducted to quantify the capacity of Technosol RGs to infiltrate stormwater and filter stormwater of chemical pollutants (i.e. NH4-N, NO3-N, P, Cu, Zn, and Pb). Based on the results of our study, shale offers the best chemical pollutant reduction, while glass and shell based Technosols have the potential to reduce greater volumes of stormwater runoff. This study illustrates the potential utility of using Technosol filter media in RG design as an alternative avenue for stormwater management to improve the hydrologic function of urban landscapes while simultaneously improving water quality.
